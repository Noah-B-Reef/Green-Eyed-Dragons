  <title>A Weighted Coin</title>
  <p>
    Consider the following puzzle:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 
      <em>
      You are given twelve coins, eleven of which have the same weight, and one of which has a weight different from the others (either heavier or lighter, you do not know). 
      You have a balance scale. What is the minimum number of weighings required in order to guarantee that you can determine which coin has the different weight, and also whether it is heavier or lighter than the rest?
      </em>
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <title>Solution</title>
  <p>
    Let's start by dividing the twelve coins into three sets of four coins each. 
    <md>
    <mrow>A \amp= \{a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4\}</mrow>
    <mrow>B \amp= \{b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4\}</mrow>
    <mrow>C \amp= \{c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4\}</mrow>
    </md>
    next we weigh set A against set B. If the two sets have the same weight, then the odd coin is in set C. In this case, weigh <m>c_1,c_2,c_3</m> against <m>a_1,a_2,a_3</m>. If the two sets have the same weight, then the odd coin is <m>c_4</m>. If the two sets have different weights, then the odd coin is one of <m>c_1,c_2,c_3</m>. Weigh <m>c_1</m> against <m>c_2</m>. If they have the same weight, then the odd coin is <m>c_3</m>. If they have different weights, then the odd coin is the lighter of the two.
