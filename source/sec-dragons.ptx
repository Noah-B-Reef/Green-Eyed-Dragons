  <title>Green-Eyed Dragons</title>
  <p>
    Consider the following puzzle:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 
      <em>
      You visit a remote desert island inhabited by one hundred very friendly dragons, all of whom have green eyes. 
      They havenâ€™t seen a human for many centuries and are very excited about your visit.
      They show you around their island and tell you all about their dragon way of life (dragons can talk, of course).
      They seem to be quite normal, as far as dragons go, but then you find out something rather odd. 
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>
      They have a rule on the island which states that if a dragon ever finds out that he/she has green eyes, 
      then at precisely midnight on the day of this discovery, he/she must relinquish all dragon powers and transform into a long-tailed sparrow.
      However, there are no mirrors on the island, and they never talk about eye color, so the dragons have been living in blissful ignorance throughout the ages.
      Upon your departure, all the dragons get together to see you off, and in a tearful farewell you thank them for being such hospitable dragons. 
      Then you decide to tell them something that they all already know (for each can see the colors of the eyes of the other dragons).
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em> 
      You tell them all that at least one of them has green eyes. Then you leave, not thinking of the consequences (if any). 
      Assuming that the dragons are (of course) infallibly logical, what happens?
      If something interesting does happen, what exactly is the new information that you gave the dragons?
      </em>
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  Open the tab below for the solution:
  </p>

  <solution>
  <p>
    All <m>100</m> dragons will transform into sparrows on the <m>100</m>th day after the visitor's departure.
  </p>
  </solution>
  
  <p>

     A more detailed explanation is as follows, first consider two key pieces of information that the dragons have to work with:
  </p>
  <definition  xml:id="def-dragon-terms">
     <ol>
       <li>Let There is <em>at least one</em> dragon with green-eyes</li>
       <li>Every dragon now knows <m>(1)</m></li>
      </ol>
  </definition>
  <subsection>
    <title>Case 1: <m>N = 1</m></title>
    <p>
       Let's first consider the case where there is a single dragon with green eyes, then you are effectively telling the single dragon it has green-eyes and so will turn into a long-tailed sparrow at midnight.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
  <title>Case 2: <m>N = 2</m></title>
    <p>
      Now let's consider the case where there are two dragons with green eyes, say <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. Then <m>A</m> will see that <m>B</m> has green eyes, and knows that if <m>B</m> sees that <m>A</m>
      doesn't have green-eyes then <m>B</m> will conclude that it is the only green-eyed dragon and transform. <m>B</m> will think the same. So on the second day <m>A</m> and <b>B</b> will see each other, conclude that
      they are both green-eyed and thus transform on the <m>2</m>nd night.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Case 3: <m>N = 3</m></title>
    <p>
    Now let's consider the case where there are three dragons with green eyes, say <m>A</m>, <m>B</m> and <m>C</m>. 
    Then <m>A</m> will see that <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> have green eyes, and knows that if <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> see that <m>A</m> doesn't have green-eyes then <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> will conclude that they are the only green-eyed dragons and transform on the <m>2</m>nd night. 
    <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> will think the same. So on the third day <m>A</m>, <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> will see each other, conclude that they are all green-eyed and thus transform on the <m>3</m>rd night.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <p>
    This pattern continues for all <m>N</m> dragons, where <m>N</m> is the number of dragons with green eyes. So we have the following theorem:
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <p>
      If there are <m>N</m> dragons with green eyes, then all <m>N</m> dragons will transform into sparrows on the <m>N</m>th day after the visitor's departure.
    </p>
  </theorem>
  <p>
  Thus on the <m>100</m>th day after the visitor's departure, all <m>100</m> dragons will transform into sparrows. The new piece of information you gave the dragons is that every dragon on the island <em>knows</em>
  there is at least one dragon with green eyes. This is the key piece of information that allows the dragons to deduce their own eye color.
